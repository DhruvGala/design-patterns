## Abstract Factory Pattern
* The Abstract Factory Pattern is a way of organizing how you create groups of things that are related to each other. 
* It provides a set of rules or instructions that let you create different types of things without knowing exactly what those things are. 
* This helps you keep everything organized and lets you switch between different types easily, following the same set of rules.

### example

* Imagine youâ€™re managing a global car manufacturing company. 
* You want to design a system to create cars with specific configurations for different regions, such as North America and Europe. 
* Each region may have unique requirements and regulations, and you want to ensure that cars produced for each region meet those standards.
