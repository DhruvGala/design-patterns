## Singleton Method Pattern

* The Singleton method or Singleton Design pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. 
* It ensures a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

### Use Case of Pattern Singleton Method
* Database Connections: In applications where creating and managing database connections is an expensive operation, a Singleton can be used to maintain a single database connection throughout the application.
  
* Configuration Management: When you have global configuration settings that need to be accessed by various components of the application, a Singleton configuration manager can provide a single point of access to these settings.
  
* GUI Components: For graphical user interface (GUI) components or controllers, a Singleton can help manage the state and actions of the UI, providing a single point of control.
  
* Device Managers: In embedded systems or applications interacting with hardware devices, a Singleton can be used to manage and control access to hardware devices to avoid conflicts.
  
* Printing Service: In systems that involve printing documents or reports, a Singleton printing service can coordinate and manage print jobs, ensuring efficient use of printing resources.
