## Decorator Pattern

* The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural design pattern used in software development. It allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is useful when you need to add functionality to objects in a flexible and reusable way.
* Consider a video streaming platform where users can watch movies and TV shows. Each video content may have additional features or options available, such as subtitles, language preferences, video quality options, and audio enhancements.


### example

* Suppose we are building a coffee shop application where customers can order different types of coffee. Each coffee can have various optional add-ons such as milk, sugar, whipped cream, etc. We want to implement a system where we can dynamically add these add-ons to a coffee order without modifying the coffee classes themselves.
