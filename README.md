## What are Design Patterns?

* Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios.

#### The design patterns are classified into three categories based on their purpose:

* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral

### Creational Patterns:

As the name suggests, creational design patterns deal with object creation. They provide different ways for you to create objects. Following these design patterns will ensure that the object instantiation process is flexible and highly efficient. This is achieved by making the system independent of the creation, composition, and representation of the object.

There are five different types of creational design patterns:

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype
